# Mock-Glasses-Delivery-Website
A little glasses delivery site that I made up using HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript.


Here was my initial write-up of the site:

Wandering Eye

Main Page:
“Just What Eye Needed” -- main page writing
    Two bubble boxes: Show Me More / Sign Me Up
Logo -- glasses
Menu bar -- Glasses Delivery / How it Works / Cities / Sign Up
Background -- Wooden
